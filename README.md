- Highlights results:
  - ‚úÖ Existing variables in **green**
  - ‚ö† Suggested candidates in **yellow**
- Priority is categorized by color as well:
  - [CRITICAL] is in **red**
  - [HIGH] is in **orange**
  - [MEDIUM] is in **yellow**
  - [LOW] is in **green**
- Optional `.env` integration with `--to-env` option:
